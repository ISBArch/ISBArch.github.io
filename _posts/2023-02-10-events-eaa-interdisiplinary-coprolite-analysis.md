Dear all,

I would like to encourage anyone working on coprolites/palaeofeces of any
animal to consider submitting an abstract to our EAA session [#573](https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2023/) on "Interdisciplinary coprolite
analysis" which aims to share novel analytical techniques and combinations
of traditional techniques in coprolite analysis (details below and
attached).

Best wishes,
Daniel on behalf of Zach and Shira

## Session: #573

### Theme & Session Format

Theme:
1. Artefacts, Buildings & Ecofacts

Session format: Regular session

### Title & Content

Title:
Interdisciplinary coprolite analysis

Content:
Intact paleofeces, or coprolites, constitute a unique type of
archaeological micro-context as short-lived time capsules of past animal or
human diet and gut microbiomes. Analyses of their components may generate
proxies for reconstructing paleoenvironment and paleoecologies, pastoral
and agricultural activity, seasonality and mobility, foodways and health,
among others. Coprolite studies are now conducted using a wide variety of
methods, among them geoarchaeological (micromorphological, mineralogical,
sedimentological), archaeobotanical (including palynological, carpological,
phytolith), parasitological, spectroscopic (Raman, NIR, FTIR), biomolecular
(genomic, proteomic, lipidomic), and isotopic (14C, δ13C, δ15N). The aim of
this session is to present both novel analytical techniques and
combinations of traditional techniques in identifying and analyzing intact
coprolites. Papers may concern feces of any animal and should ultimately
relate to research questions relevant to archaeology. While all papers
should have a strong methodological component, case studies demonstrating
the value of multi-proxy and interdisciplinary approaches to coprolite
analysis are very much encouraged.
