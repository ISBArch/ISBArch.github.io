Dear all,

Archaeology thrives on its intrinsic interdisciplinary nature, drawing from a diverse range of disciplines. To discuss and promote the powerful combination of techniques such as DNA analysis, isotope analysis, dating  methodologies, palaeobotany, osteological analysis, spatial analysis, and environmental archaeology, we are inviting to join the symposium:

Advancing archaeology with multi-disciplinary analysis
