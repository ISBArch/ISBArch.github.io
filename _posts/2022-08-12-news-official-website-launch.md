**From our provisional Secretary, Oliver Craig (University of York):**

It is a pleasure to (pre-)launch our new International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology (ISBA) and announce the date for the next meeting, our 10th!, which will be in Tartu, Estonia on the 13-16 September 2023.

Details of the society and the meeting can be found on our new website here: [about](/about) and [meetings](/meetings).

We are still waiting for the outcome of our application to the UK charity commission to register our society. Hopefully once this is in order, you will be able to apply for [membership](/membership).

Please feel free to publicise the society more widely through your channels.

For future messages and updates - please join our official mailing list: [http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/ISBARCH](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/ISBARCH).

You can also follow us on twitter [@ISBArchaeology](https://twitter.com/ISBArchaeology).

Thanks to everyone who has worked so hard behind the scenes to make this happen!
