Expression of Interest to Host ISBA12

**University of Burgos (UBU), Burgos, Spain**

The city of Burgos has an emerging international presence in biomolecular archaeology, with recent state-of-the-art stable isotope, palaeoproteomics, and ancient DNA facilities established at the University of Burgos (UBU) and the National Research Center for Human Evolution (CENIEH). Our researchers encompass a wide breadth of expertise with decades of experience in biomolecular archaeology and global connections that we consider important in creating a diverse and welcoming conference. We would welcome the  opportunity to showcase our progress in these areas over the next two years and that of our  colleagues in other areas of Spain. 

ISBA12 will encompass the breadth of biomolecular archaeology, with multiple parallel sessions facilitated by the spaces afforded to UBU and CENIEH. We hope that delegates draw from the local history of the Burgos region as a backdrop to inspire their work; from those interested in Atapuerca (known for assemblages related to human evolution and early prehistory all the way through to the Roman period), the monuments to the Castilian knight Él Cid, or the city’s iconic Gothic Cathedral. 

Burgos was a medieval capital for northern Spain and is a modern-day centre for archaeological research. The city is easily accessible from major airports by bus or train and most tourist attractions can be reached on foot in and around the city center. Burgos is a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy, famous for the modern Castilian cuisine in its numerous bars and restaurants.
