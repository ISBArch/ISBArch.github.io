Dear colleagues,

(Apologies for cross-posting)
We are pleased to announce the session #848 "The archaeogenetics of ancient Italy: socio-cultural changes, interaction, and mobility from Prehistory to the Middle Ages"  which we are hosting at the Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists (EAA), taking place August 28-31 2024 in Rome. As in the last years, the meeting is held as a hybrid event, so you also have the possibility to attend remotely.

We look forward to an engaging exchange on the insights archaeogenetic research brings to multidisciplinary studies of the rich archaeological heritage of Italy, addressing questions of continuity and change in social organization, mobility, connectivity, kinship, gender, and ethnicity from site-specific to broader interregional contexts. Please find the full abstract attached.

If you are interested in participating, we would be delighted if you submit your abstract for an oral presentation directly through the [event website](https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2024/), by the deadline on February 8th, 2024. 
Please note that this year, posters are submitted separately (deadline April 8, 2024) to themes rather than sessions. If you are planning on presenting a poster that fits this session, please contact us so that we may advertise it in our session.

Don't hesitate to contact us with any questions you might have.

With best wishes for 2024,
Francesco Fontani, Serena Sabatini, Stefania Vai, Gabriele Scorrano, Lorenzo Antonelli, Serena Aneli and [Alissa Mittnik](mailto:alissa_mittnik@EVA.MPG.DE)
