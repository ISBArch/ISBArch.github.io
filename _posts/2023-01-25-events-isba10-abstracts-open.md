With the 10th Meeting of the [ISBA](https://www.isbarch.org/) entitled “New Horizons in Biomolecular Archaeology”, we look forward to offering you an engaging and inspiring conference to exchange experiences and novel ideas. After three years of virtual-only meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ISBA10 marks a return to in-person conferences. Thus, to provide a productive and engaging environment for scientific exchange and collaboration, and guarantee the best possible experience and synergy we invite you to Tartu, the [City of Good Thoughts](https://tartu.ee/en/city-of-good-thoughts), (Estonia)

The conference will take place on the **13th to the 16th of September 2023** in Tartu, Estonia. Mark your calendars!

The abstract submission is now open! We are looking forward to your [abstracts](https://isba10.ut.ee/abstract-submission.html) about biomolecular advancements in archaeology. Please submit your abstract **before 15th of March 2023**.

More information about the conference and updates are available on the ISBA10 conference website: [https://isba10.ut.ee/](https://isba10.ut.ee/).
