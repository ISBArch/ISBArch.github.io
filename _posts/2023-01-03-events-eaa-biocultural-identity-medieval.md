Dear colleagues,  

Yet another EAA session but a really interesting one so please have a look below!

We are inviting contributions to Session 697 “So different, yet so similar: biocultural identity and plurality in the medieval and post-medieval world”.  We are interested in discussing and presenting case studies that assess identity formation processes in the medieval and post-medieval period. We welcome papers and posters exploring processes of identity formation as a result of migration, colonisation and other forms of population mobility; the identification and reconstruction of biocultural diversity through multi- and cross- disciplinary approach; non-linear power dynamics and dependencies between cultural groups.

Contributions can be submitted until the 9th of February [online](https://www.e-a-a.org/EAA2023/Programme.aspx?WebsiteKey=4c013ea5-de96-432a-85f7-b1800c2303bf&hkey=f73d6cf5-b37e-4836-ad06-2ecea6b58060&Program=3#Program).

We would be grateful if you could circulate this through your channels and we are looking forward to receive your submissions! 

Best wishes
