Expression of Interest to Host ISBA12

**Brussels Bioarchaeology Lab, Vrije Universiteit of Brussels, Belgium**

The Brussels Bioarchaeology Lab is a group of more than 20 researchers, renowned for its interdisciplinary approach, combining osteoarchaeology, infrared, and isotope analysis to explore past populations’ diets, mobility, health, and funerary practices. Its strong focus on both scientific rigor and societal relevance makes it an ideal environment for meaningful academic exchange. Vrije Universiteit Brussel itself is a progressive institution rooted in principles of free inquiry and international collaboration, providing a vibrant academic community for visiting researchers. 

ISBA12 in Brussels will continue to strengthen links between the wide spectrum of biomolecular archaeology, with sessions focussing on a range of methodological developments and research questions. While the BB-LAB is focused on osteology (including a large zooarchaeology component), archaeobotany (phytoliths), as well as isotope analyses (of humans,  non-human animals, and plants), co-organisers from KU Leuven, ULB, and UGent, specialising in aDNA, proteomics, and organic residue analyses will ensure a transdisciplinary symposium. As such we can ensure the optimal coverage of all topics related to biomolecular  archaeology. Diversity in topics is only one side of the coin, our vision for ISBA12 is also to ensure diversity as well as social and financial accessibility for all participants; from all career stages, institutions, and backgrounds, from all over the world. 

As the capital of Belgium and the European Union, Brussels blends a rich history with a cosmopolitan and open-minded atmosphere. The heritage-covered market Halles Saint-Géry, the Royal Library of Belgium, the art-deco venue Albert Hall, and the Royal Flemish Theatre are all being considered as different event spaces for ISBA12, allowing conference attendees the opportunity of visiting these historic spaces as part of the symposium. Finally, Brussels is well-connected by high-speed rail and several international airports making it easy, eco-friendly, and affordable to get to from all over Europe and beyond.
