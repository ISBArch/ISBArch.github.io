The LAARD community will hold its first in-person meeting in Turin on Tuesday August 26, just before the start of the ISBA11 conference. To promote the visibility of as much work on lipids as possible, this day will be divided between the following activities:


- **talks from early career researchers** whose abstracts have been downgraded to posters for ISBA11;
- **mini-poster session dedicated to lipids and/or a flash-talk session**, to present the posters directly to the community and facilitate discussion around them;
- roundtables on the following topic: **‘Guidelines for publishing lipid data from an ORA and archaeological perspective’**.
 

We kindly invite participants to contribute to the catering costs. **To make your contribution to the LAARD meeting** (10€ for students and early career researchers, 15€ for others), **please use the dedicated Paypal button**.
