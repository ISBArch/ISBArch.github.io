Dear colleagues, 

The next Annual Meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists (EAA) will take place in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from August 30 to September 2, 2023, fully hybrid again.

We are very pleased to invite your contributions to our session #542 “Reconstructing Biological Relatedness and Inferring Human Relations in the Past”. The abstract for the session can be seen [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366545198_EAA_2023_Belfast_-_Call_for_papers_542_Reconstructing_Biological_Relatedness_and_Inferring_Human_Relations_in_the_Past).

We aim to bring together social and biological data to understand the complexities of past kinship through integrative discussions. 

The contributions can be submitted until February 9, 2023 online ([https://eaa.klinkhamergroup.com/eaa2023/](https://eaa.klinkhamergroup.com/eaa2023/)), both in the form of an oral communication or a poster.

We hope to see many of you there!
