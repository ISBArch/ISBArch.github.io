Dear Colleagues,

[MHAAM](https://archaeoscience.org) is pleased to announce our 2023 Global Young Investigator Symposium in The Science of the Human Past, and would be very grateful for your support to contact current and former students about this unique opportunity.  We were gratified in 2022 that the discipline of archaeoscience was honored by the award of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to colleague [Svante Pääbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps79u_jEA3g) in Leipzig, Germany, and will continue in our efforts to connect with and help to train the next generation of explorers:

 

[The Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean (MHAAM)](https://www.archaeoscience.org/), a collaboration between [The Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard (SoHP)](https://sohp.fas.harvard.edu/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany (MPI-EVA)](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/) announces an opportunity for undergraduate juniors and seniors, and early-career current or recent Master’s students, to participate in a virtual **Global Young Investigator Symposium on Friday, November 3, 2023**.  International students will have an opportunity to present cross-disciplinary research utilizing science to illuminate the history of humanity, and to network with other students and faculty members similarly engaged. An interest in the Ancient Mediterranean is desirable but not indispensable. Opportunities for further work or study may become available. This global event will take place via Zoom from 9:00 am – 12:00 pm (EDT).

Students interested in applying for the Symposium should arrange to send a letter of application, an abstract of research to be presented, a CV, an academic transcript, and, separately, a letter of recommendation, to be submitted by October 6, 2023 to [sohpchair@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:sohpchair@fas.harvard.edu)

Further information on MHAAM can be found at: [archaeoscience.org](https://archaeoscience.org), and inquiries can be sent to: [sohpchair@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:sohpchair@fas.harvard.edu)

The previous 4th Annual Global Young Investigator Symposium, brought together 20 undergraduate and Master’s students from 15 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.

We truly appreciate your help to announce this wonderful opportunity for students and early career (pre-PhD program) investigators!

All best wishes,
