We are pleased to invite you to submit a contribution for [session 834](https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2024/sessions/overview/preview.php?id=834) "Women through the Ages: Roles, Rituals, and Research through the Lenses of Archaeological Sciences" at the 30th European Association of Archaeologists Annual Meeting that will take place in Rome, Italy (28 - 31 August 2024).

During this session, we would like to discuss the interdisciplinary approaches used to study women in the past and, in particular, how bioarchaeological methodologies are helping us remove biases from the interpretations.
