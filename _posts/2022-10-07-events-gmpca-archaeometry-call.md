The 24th edition of GMPCA-Archaeometry symposium will take place for the first time in Nice, from 17 to 21 April 2023

The conference is organised by the CEPAM (CNRS/Université Côte d'Azur), an interdisciplinary research unit characterised by a broad interface between the humanities, natural sciences and physicochemical sciences, allowing the study of diverse archaeological remains, from artefacts and ecofacts to landscapes, over a wide chronology from the earliest prehistory to the Middle Ages.

From the Acheulean settlements to the 19th century winter resort town, Nice has a rich heritage over a very long period of time, which can be experienced at this next GMPCA conference.

Papers in both French and English are welcome!

Themes and paper proposals can be seen and submitted until 20 November 2022 on the conference website:
