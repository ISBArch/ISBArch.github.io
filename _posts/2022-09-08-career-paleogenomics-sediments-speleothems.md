4-year post-doctoral position in Paleogenomics to analyze archaeological sediments and speleothems in the framework of the ERC St G project “MicroStratDNA” Reconstructing Paleolithic Population Dynamics Using Microstratified Paleogenomics” by M. Stahlschmidt and in collaboration with the Pinhasi Lab at the University of Vienna.

MicroStratDNA is positioned at the intersection of geoarchaeology and archaeogenomics and concerned with the formation history of environmental sources of DNA pertaining to archaeological questions and with a focus on human aDNA

Requirements for the post are a doctoral degree in Paleogenomics and experience with the extraction, sequencing and data analysis of ancient DNA.

Experience in archaeogenomics/interdisciplinary research with archaeologist or in working with environmental samples is of advantage but not a requirement.

The ideal candidate will have fluent English language skills, a strong publication record, be able to work independently but also willing to actively engage with other disciplines involved in the project.

The position will be situated in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna. The department has a strong focus on paleogenomics with several research groups on the subject.

The position is full time, but part time options can be discussed, and the start is also flexible but no later than July, 2023. For informal enquiries and applications (Motivation letter with two referees, CV, relevant certificates) email [mareike.stahlschmidt@univie.ac.at](mailto: mareike.stahlschmidt@univie.ac.at) Deadline October 15th
