The NCBI SRA would like to hear feedback from the ancient DNA community about how we access and use data in their databases. They are experiencing data storage limitations, and they are considering making changes to fastq file storage, including archiving of fastq files. However, first they would like to know more about our needs. 

To access the form, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevgtQSSqbMsJAFqG8Y8y0RD-dxmf5vVkEIYPQ3P82hk0TQEw/viewform) or scan the QR code:
