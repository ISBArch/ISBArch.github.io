The next UK Archaeological Sciences (UKAS) meeting will be held at the University of York, 3â€“5th April 2024.  

We are now seeking abstract submissions over a range of themes, including:

- Biomolecular archaeology
- Zooarchaeology
- Archaeobotany
- Geoarchaeology
- Osteoarchaeology and palaeopathology
- Materials analysis
- Heritage science and conservation
- Archaeological dating techniques
- Spatial and data analysis

We are particularly interested in abstracts that bridge the themes above. Delegates are limited to a single presentation as first/presenting author. 
 
The call for abstracts will close 18 December 2023 and authors will be notified of the outcome in mid-January 2024. Conference registration will open in late 2023. 

Abstracts of up to 250 words can be submitted via our online submission system.

Please circulate this to your departments and any other people you think may be interested.

If you have any queries, please email [ukas2024@york.ac.uk](mailto:ukas2024@york.ac.uk). 

With best wishes,

The UKAS organising team
