Hello Everyone!

We are thrilled to announce that registration for the first in-person Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) meeting since the pandemic is beginning, SPAAM5, is open! This year we are holding a one-day only in-person meeting on September 12th, 2023 in Tartu, Estonia. We are taking advantage of this year’s ISBA meeting in the same location to meet in person the day before it starts. As attendance is limited, we will give priority to early career researchers. This meeting will feature networking, flash talks, and more! But if you can’t make it, don’t worry, another online-only meeting will be held in November to make sure as many people as possible can participate in SPAAM5. Additionally, anyone who cannot present in person during the Tartu meetings this September will be prioritized for online-only presentations in November.

To register for the in-person event, please fill out this form by June 16: [https://forms.gle/nJUMGzTmH6Knuy7R9](https://forms.gle/nJUMGzTmH6Knuy7R9).  

For selected participants, a 15 Euro registration fee will be collected prior to the start of the meeting and will cover lunch, coffee and refreshments. Registration waivers are available upon request: please contact [spaam.events@gmail.com](mailto:spaam.events@gmail.com).

More information can be seen [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/events/2023/04/26/news_SPAAM5-registration/).

Looking forward to finally meeting in person,

Megan Michel
