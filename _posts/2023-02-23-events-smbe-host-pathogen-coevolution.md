Dear colleagues, 

We would like to invite you to submit an abstract to our SMBE 2023 symposium, "Host-pathogen co-evolutionary dynamics through the lens of paleogenomics." The SMBE 2023 will be held in beautiful Ferrara, Italy, from July 23 to July 27.

The aim of this symposium is to assemble findings from the field of Paleogenomics addressing the interactions between pathogens and their hosts throughout human history, such as pathogen origins and spread, the genetic processes involved in the emergence of epidemics among past human populations, and the evolutionary mechanisms underlying human adaptation to infectious disease exposure.

More information can be seen at [https://www.smbe2023.org/symposia](https://www.smbe2023.org/symposia).

During this symposia, two outstanding invited speakers will be featured: **Maria A. Spyrou** with a title talk, "Investigating the genomic history of plague, from the Neolithic to the present" and **Gaspard Kerner** presenting "A time-series aDNA approach detects genetic adaptation to pathogens in post-Neolithic Europe".

The deadline for abstract submission will be on the 15th of March. See the website for more details [https://www.smbe2023.org/abstractsubmission](https://www.smbe2023.org/abstractsubmission). 

Please, feel free to forward this to colleagues and students that might be interested !!

Let us know if you have any further questions. 

Best,

Dr. Federica Pierini (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology)

Dr. Linda Ongaro (Trinity College Dublin)

Dr. Marco Rosario Capodiferro (Trinity College Dublin)
