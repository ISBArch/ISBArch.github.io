The ISBA10 conference organisation is happy to see that over 200 people have already registered for the ISBA10 conference held in Tartu on the 13th to 16th of September 2023. We can accept 450 attendees altogether due to the capacity of the conference venue. 

Based on the exceptionally high number of submissions, we recommend registering early, so use this opportunity and [register here](https://isba10.ut.ee/registration). Please note that the early bird registration is now closed. If you happen to encounter any problems with payments, do not hesitate to contact the organizing committee: [isba2023@ut.ee](mailto:isba2023@ut.ee). We apologize in advance for any technical inconveniences. Invoices for travel reimbursements can be issued upon request ([isba2023@ut.ee](mailto:isba2023@ut.ee)). 

**To make the decision to register easier for you, you will find the provisional scientific program of the conference is available [here](/assets/documents/ISBA10/ISBA_10_program.pdf)**.

Please see the main [ISBA10 conference website](https://isba10.ut.ee) for the latest information.

The program includes **87 talks** from researchers around the globe, including two keynote speakers – **Anne Stone and Carl Heron** – and five invited talks by researchers representing different fields ofbiomolecular archaeology: **Giedrė Motuzaitė Matuzevičiūtė, Beatrice Demarchi, Melanie Roffet Salque, Benjamin Vernot** and **Martin Petr**. Furthermore, there will be **over 150 posters** of which 24 will be presented as flash talks. Details about these will be sent later. Thank you for your patience!

**For students and postdocs**: we will soon send out a call for bursaries that allow five students giving an oral presentation to get a reduced attendance fee. These bursaries are provided by the ISBA Society.
