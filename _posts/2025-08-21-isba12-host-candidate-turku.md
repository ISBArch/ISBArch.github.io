Expression of Interest to Host ISBA12

**University of Turku, Turku, Finland**

Bioarchaeological research in the 21st century requires solid communication and engagement between various fields of science to produce a nuanced and holistic picture of the past. Furthermore, community inclusion and meaningful public engagement are vital components of ethical bioarchaeology. At ISBA12: Communities, Engagement, and Outreach, we will promote research that builds interdisciplinary bridges and highlights the inclusion of descendant communities and stakeholders in the scientific process and the public communication of results. 

Our interdisciplinary team consists of archaeologists, geneticists, and isotope and proteomic researchers from all career stages. We have an excited and experienced organising committee with previous experience in scientific conferences and symposia ([EMPSEB 26](https://www.ucc.ie/en/bees/news/2019/empseb-26-to-be-held-in-killarney.html), [Oikos Finland 2023](https://nordicsocietyoikos.glueup.com/event/oikos-finland-2023-conference-65152/), [ESEB 2019 aDNA symposium](https://eseb.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ESEB2019_Program.pdf)), a museum exhibition ([Ancient DNA - Key to the Past](https://www.vapriikki.fi/en/exhibition/ancient-dna-a-key-to-the-past/)), and the largest non-commercial role-playing convention in Europe ([Ropecon Finland](https://ropecon.fi/en/ropecon-in-english/this-is-ropecon/), 10k visitors in 2025).

ISBA12 will be held in Turku, at the [Logomo Event Centre](https://logomo.fi/en/information), equipped with a scalable, dynamic room plan, state-of-the-art audio-visual system, on-site catering, and air conditioning. Turku is Finland’s oldest city and the former capital, with historical charm, rich gastronomic tradition, and a thriving urban scene. The city is easily explored on foot or by bike. The more adventurous can explore further afield and discover the Finnish Archipelago! August weather in Turku is usually sunny with comfortable temperatures. Finland is widely considered safe and accessible for foreign travellers. According to ILGA-Europe, LGBTQ+ rights in Finland are some of the most progressive in the world and Finland is considered safe for LGBTQ+ visitors.
