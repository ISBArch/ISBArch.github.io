The Technical University of Denmark (DTU)   is looking for a qualified
candidate for a PhD position in Bioinformatics.

In this position, you will develop algorithms and computational
methods to deal with the analysis of large datasets from modern and
ancient sources. More specifically, these algorithms will be aimed at
analyzing human genomes from sedimentary DNA. The bioinformatics
section of DTU Health Tech performs research in the areas of different
metagenomics, machine learning, cancer genomics and population
genomics.

Current bioinformatics algorithms and software are often ill-equipped
to deal with DNA extracted from ancient soil samples. This ancient DNA
shows high levels of fragmentation and accumulated chemical damage.
Furthermore, ancient sediments often contain DNA from multiple species
and often multiple individuals. Fortunately, several problems
pertaining to ancient DNA can be described in a maximum-likelihood
framework and computer science techniques can help us to solve such
numerical problems efficiently via numerical algorithms and data
structures. You will work in collaboration with other partners
including the University of Copenhagen and McMaster University in
order to develop the next generation of algorithms and software
applied to DNA extract from fossils, ancient soils and sediments.

Qualifications
You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a
similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year
master's degree. Ideally, your degree should be in computer science,
mathematics or biological science with a focus on quantitative and
mathematical aspects.

More specifically you should ideally have the following qualifications:
* Knowledge of a programming language like Python, Perl, C++ and/or
Java (C/C++ is preferred)
* Ability to work in a UNIX environment, ideally in a high-performance
computing environment
* Thorough understanding of basic algorithms and data structures used
in computer science
* Knowledge of probabilities and statistics
* Firm grasp of first-year university mathematics (differential
calculus/linear algebra)
* Experience in bioinformatics and knowledge of metagenomics are a plus
* Expertise in next-generation sequencing data generation and
processing are also a plus

The language of communication at DTU is English.

Application procedure
Your complete online application must be submitted no later than 14
June 2022 (Danish time). Applications must be submitted as one PDF
file containing all materials to be given consideration. To apply,
please open the link "Apply online", fill out the online application
form, and attach all your materials in English in one PDF file. The
file must include:

A letter motivating the application (cover letter)
* Curriculum vitae
* Grade transcripts and BSc/MSc diploma (in English) including an
official description of the grading scale
* Link to a code portfolio stored in repositories like
GitHub/bitbucket is not required but helpful

You may apply prior to obtaining your master's degree but cannot begin
before having received it.

All interested candidates irrespective of age, gender, race,
disability, religion or ethnic background are encouraged to apply.

Applications received after the deadline will not be considered.

Deadline: September 15th 2022
