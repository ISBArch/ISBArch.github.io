Dear all!

Call for abstracts for the ISBA 11 Meeting at Turin, Italy has been extended till the end of January (31/01/2025). 11 days to go! Spread the word and submit your abstracts!

We welcome submissions from researchers who answer critical questions about the past using biomolecular and geochemical approaches (isotopes, lipids and metabolites, proteins, and DNA). ISBA 11 aims to spotlight interdisciplinary research where results are clear, robust, and impactful. Abstracts will be selected based on scientific excellence, as well as our commitment to equality, diversity, and inclusion.
