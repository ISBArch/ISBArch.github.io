Dear all,

We are happy to confirm that the one-day hybrid MInAS Development Event will be held on the 13th June 2024 between 10:00-18:00 CEST.

The [MInAS project](http://www.mixs-minas.org/) aims to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes of ancient DNA samples and sequencing data via community-based consensus and training.

This one-day online/hybrid event will involve:

- Introductory presentations of the project
- Group-development of the next version of the MInAS checklist (v0.2.0)
- Generation of additional discipline-specific ancient DNA metadata checklists
- Training on how to give checklist feedback sessions to other groups / reading MIxS or MInAS checklists
- Planning and strategy discussion of the project

The event will be online using Zoom, and for those who can make it in-person in Copenhagen, Denmark.

If you're interested in joining online (whole day), please email [info@mixs-minas.org](mailto:info@mixs-minas.org) for the Zoom link, with the following details

- your name

For those interested in joining in-person (afternoon-only due to room availability), please send the details as above to the mailing list to get the morning Zoom link. For the afternoon, please meet us at 13:00 by the Meteorite at the entrance of the Natural History Museum of Denmark (Ã˜ster Voldgade 5-7, 1350 Copenhagen K)
