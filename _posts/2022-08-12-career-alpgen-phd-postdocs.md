The AlpGen project aims to explore the population history of the circum-Alpine region between 4,000 to 600 BCE. This period sees the rise and fall of the Alpine lake dwellings which represent one of the most important archaeological archives of prehistoric Europe. The AlpGen project aims to shed new light on these communities and their connections to wider prehistoric Europe.

The AlpGen project, based at the GLOBE Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark), is hiring a PhD student, 2 postdocs, and a Research Assistance to work on ancient metagenomics and the population history of the circum-Alpine region.
