The Biomolecular Palaeoanthropology research group at the University of Copenhagen has a two-year postdoctoral position open in computational palaeoproteomics.

The position is part of the ongoing ERC StG project “PROSPER” that aims to develop and apply novel analytical approaches to study Middle and Late Pleistocene hominin proteomes. Suitable candidates would have a background in either palaeoproteomics, ancient DNA, or (human) population genomics. You will join an interdisciplinary research group interested in studying human evolution through palaeoproteomics and associated biomolecules, based at the Globe Institute (UCPH).
