Dear friends and colleagues,

We would like to invite you to join our session at this yearâ€™s EAA conference in Belfast!

Our aim is to bring together researchers who are interested in studying ancient diseases in different ways. While we would like to include researchers who use palaeopathology, historic records, aDNA, and proteomics to study pathogens and infectious diseases, we are happy to include scientists from any related discipline. The goal is to share findings and ideas from different perspectives and research methods in a supportive group setting. 

See our session abstract below, and feel free to forward this to students or colleagues you think may be interested! Also note the extended deadline for abstract submission on Monday, 13 February 2023, 23:59 CET.


Best,
Shevan and Kerttu
