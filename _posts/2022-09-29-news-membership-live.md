We are happy to announce we have opened up the membership registration page!

Please go to [membership](/membership) for details how to register.

ISBA sponsors a wide range of initiatives to support biomolecular archaeology, including a biennial ISBA meeting, student poster and presentation prizes, article awards, and workshop micro-grants.

Membership helps to fund these initiatives and to support the maintenance of our website, listserv, and social media accounts.
Membership is required for ISBA conference registration.
