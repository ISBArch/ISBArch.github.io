The 24th edition of GMPCA-Archaeometry symposium will take place for the
first time in Nice, from 17 to 21 April 2023.

The conference is organised by the CEPAM (CNRS/Université Côte d'Azur), an
interdisciplinary research unit characterised by a broad interface between
the humanities, natural and physicochemical sciences, allowing the study of
diverse archaeological remains, from artefacts and ecofacts to landscapes,
over a wide chronology from the earliest prehistory to the Middle Ages.

From the Acheulean settlements to the 19th century winter resort town, Nice
has a rich heritage over a very long period of time, which can be
experienced at this next GMPCA conference.

Papers in both French and English are welcome!

The call for papers will be launched in the coming weeks.
