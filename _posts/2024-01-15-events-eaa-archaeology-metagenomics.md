Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to invite you to submit a contribution for the session #854: “Building bridges: an open forum for archaeology and metagenomics”  that we are organizing at the 30th European Association of Archaeologists (EAA) Annual Meeting, which will take place from the 28 to the 31 of August 2024, in Rome, Italy. The event offers a hybrid format, allowing participants the flexibility to attend and present either online or onsite.

With this session, we aim to bring together experts from both archaeology and metagenomics to showcase projects at the intersection of these fields.
We are particularly interested in presentations that highlight collaborative efforts, and to this end, we are promoting "tandem presentations" featuring an expert from each field. In addition to these joint talks, we will also feature conventional talks that showcase research from the individual disciplines of expertise. Our session aims to connect diverse disciplines and foster a more interconnected comprehension of our collective heritage.

You can find more information in the session abstract [https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2024/sessions/overview/preview.php?id=854](https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2024/sessions/overview/preview.php?id=854).

If you are interested in joining us for the session, we would be glad if you submit your abstract for an oral contribution through the website [https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2024/](https://submissions.e-a-a.org/eaa2024/) by the 8 February 2024.
Abstracts must be between 150 and 300 words and should contain 3 to 6 keywords and up to 10 authors.
