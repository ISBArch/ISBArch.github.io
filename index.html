<i>The Board and Members of the International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology wish to congratulate Svante Pääbo on his receipt of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology! The ancient DNA field would not exist without the groundbreaking contributions of Svante Pääbo and his research group, and the field of biomolecular archaeology as a whole is a rich and vibrant community today thanks to his pioneering efforts and vision.</i>
