This page are graphical versions of the instructions on the [registering to the chat platform](/chat) page.

Please read that page first for more information.

## Sign up

### Create an account

1. Go to [https://chat.archaeo.social/#/welcome](https://chat.archaeo.social/#/welcome) in your web browser to create an account and follow the instructions

   - ⚠️ make sure the server is set to ‘archaeo.social’ (URL: [https://matrix.archaeo.social](https://matrix.archaeo.social)) and NOT just the default ‘matrix.org’

2. Fill in the username and password details as necessary

3. Check your email account to confirm the account
   - The confirmation email might take up to 10m to arrive in your mail post
   - Don't forget to check your spam folder!
4. Confirm your password as instructed in the email
5. Skip the onboarding _survey_

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/signup-skip-onboarding-survey.png">

6. You should then see the initial chat page of the archaeo.social workspace!
   - Note that this is _not_ yet the ISBA space but the common space of the archaeo.social collective!
   - Feel free to go through the onboarding steps (e.g. turn on notifications)
7. _To join the ISBA space_: in the search bar at the top,

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/signup-explore-rooms-isba.png">

8. Search for `#isba:archaeo.social`

   - If this does not work, go to the following link in your web browser [https://matrix.to/#/#isba:archaeo.social](https://matrix.to/#/#isba:archaeo.social) and open the redirect in your Element client/app

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/signup-explore-rooms-landing.png">

9. Once you're in the ISBA space, should see at least two public 'rooms' (a.k.a. channels) - General and Random.

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/signup-sidebar-rooms.png">

10. Go to to the room 'Introductions'

    - If you don't see the 'Introduction' room in your side bar, press the `+` symbol next to the 'Room' section of the side bar

    - Press 'Explore rooms'

       <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/signup-explore-rooms-isba.png">

    - Press the 'Join' button that will appear next to the 'Introdutions' room (in this case I've already joined)

11. Introduce yourself!

## Verification

### First step: encryption

1. Open the personal settings menu (click on your face/profile picture in the top left)

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-settings-menu.png">

2. Go to the ‘Security and Privacy’ section
3. In the menu, under Encryption, and Secure Backup, press ‘Set up’

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-settings-encryption.png">

4. Select either generate a security key (similar to Two-factor authentication backup OTP codes), or enter a security phrase (like a second password)

   - Even if you use a security phrase, you will get a security key (in case you forget your phrase)
   - You’ll then be asked to confirm your password (not phrase or key!)

      <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-backup-options.png">

5. Insert your security phrase

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-security-phrase-input.png">

6. Confirm your security phrase

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-security-phrase-confirmation.png">

7. Save the security key somewhere safe (e.g. print it off and store somewhere secure!)

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-security-key.png">

8. Press done to complete the process

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/encryption-success.png">

### Second step: Cross-sign

1. If not already in a session, log into the first session (e.g., in the web-browser client as at the end of the procedure for ‘sign up’)
2. Make sure cross-signing is available

   - Go to personal settings menu (click on your face/profile picture in the top left)

      <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/crosssign-settings-menu.png">

   - Navigate to Security and Privacy > Cross-signing

      <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/crosssign-settings-crosssigning.png">

   - Make sure it says ‘Cross-signing is ready for use’ (if it does not say this, check the encryption step above)

3. Log into the second session on a different client with your account and password (e.g., the Element mobile app, see all options above)
4. After logging in you will be prompted to 'verify with another device'

   - This may come up as notification or a banner at the top of the session

      <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/crosssign-verify-device.png">

5. Press the ‘verify’ button, and follow the instructions
6. Go to your other device, and you should have a notification to ‘verify session’

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/crosssign-verificationrequested.png">

7. Press 'verify'
8. Follow the instructions to either cross-compare an emoji combination displayed on both sessions, or scan a QR code (in this case, I only had one option)

   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/crosssign-method-options.png">
   <img src="/assets/images/tutorials/element_matrix/crosssign-emoji-compare.png">

9. Press verify on both sessions when you see the shield. You should then be done
