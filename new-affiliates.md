## New Affiliate Community

Affiliate groups defined as researcher communities and working groups that support education, community-building, and research in biomolecular archaeology.

Requirements for ISBA affiliate groups are as follows:

- Min. 10 members
- Min. representation of two institutions
- Min. one meeting (online or in person) per calendar year
- Annual reporting to the ISBA Board
- Representative participation at the ISBA biennial conference AGM meetings to report on the group (online option available).

If you wish to set up a new ISBA affiliate group please contact ISBA Programming and Affiliate Coordinator (via [email](mailto:programming@isbarch.org)) outlining the purpose of your group and why you want to become affiliated with the ISBA society.

## Existing Affiliate Groups

We require an annual report summarising basic statistics about the affiliate community as well as major activities and achievements.

Please fill in this annual report [form](https://forms.gle/hRMwvQLy4hAGHjxC7) by the **31st of January every year**.

Also please make sure to inform the ISBA affiliate coordinate (via [email](mailto:programming@isbarch.org)) in a timely manner of any change to steering committees or contact person(s).
