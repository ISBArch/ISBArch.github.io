## Code of Conduct for ISBA meetings

Our society has its origins in the biennial International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology, a meeting which has taken place since 2004. The meetings are the heart of the society, and as such, the society has a code of conduct which describes the expected behaviour of all participants at the biennial meeting, and any of our other organised events.

### Behavioural expectations

It is the expectation of the society that meeting attendees treat everyone with respect and consideration. This includes not only other attendees, but also volunteers, exhibitors and meeting facility staff. We expect attendees to respect diversity, and that includes opinions that are different to your own. We therefore ask that meeting attendees communicate openly, thoughtfully and considerately with others, and that they are respectful of critiques of their own ideas and opinions.

Certain behaviours are unacceptable, including any form of harassment, intimidation, or abuse, whether through verbal, written or physical conduct. Anyone requested to stop such behaviour is expected to cease immediately. Additionally, society or conference staff, or venue security may take any action deemed necessary to prevent further violation of the code of conduct, including removal from the venue, and prohibiting further attendance of the meeting.

### Reporting unacceptable behaviour

If you are the subject of unacceptable behaviour or have witnessed any such behaviour, you can report it to the ISBA Diversity and Inclusion Officer Dr. Shinya Shoda ([ombudsperson@isbarch.org](mailto:ombudsperson@isbarch.org)), or any other member of the ISBA Board or Conference Committee.

Anyone experiencing or witnessing behaviour that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety, or behavior that constitutes a criminal act, is expected to contact the appropriate law enforcement agency. Those witnessing a potential criminal act should also take actions necessary to maintain their own personal safety.

### Digital images and social media

Do not photograph a poster or record a talk without the authorâ€™s expressed permission. Our default assumption is to allow open discussion of presentations on social media; however, attendees are expected to respect any request by an author to not disseminate the contents of their talk or poster.
