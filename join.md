ISBA sponsors a wide range of initiatives to support biomolecular archaeology, including a biennial ISBA meeting, student poster and presentation prizes, article awards, and workshop micro-grants.
ISBA membership helps to fund these initiatives and to support the maintenance of our website, listserv, social media accounts, and chat service.
Members also can stand as trustees on the board, nominate their institutes to host future biennial International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology conference events, and also get discounts on symposium registration.
