The International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology (ISBA) is a community of researchers working on degraded biological remains from a range of archaeological, paleoanthropological, and paleontological contexts. The society aims to promote the study of ancient biomolecules to better understand our shared human past.

ISBA organizes a biennial [ISBA conference](/category/meetings.md) that has grown to more than 600 international participants since its [founding](/pastmeetings.md) in 2004. [Society membership](/membership) supports our biennial [research prizes and awards](/awards), as well as [micro-grants](/funding) for workshops. Please see our [Meetings](/category/meetings) page for information about conference registration and abstract submission.

ISBA uses Twitter ([@ISBArchaeology](https://twitter.com/ISBArchaeology)), the [ISBARCH mailing list](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/ISBARCH), as well as our website, to disseminate the [our latest news](/category/news) about our upcoming meetings, events, and other activities. For more information about or upcoming and past events, please see our [Events](/events) page.

ISBA is governed and structured under rules and regulations set by the [Charity Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission). See our [Board](/board) page for more information.

## History

<img align="right" width="300" src="/assets/images/misc/tube_rack.png">
ISBA, the International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology, began as a small, biennial symposium organized by Prof. Henk Kars in the Netherlands in 2004. Nine [international meetings](/pastmeetings.md) were held between 2004 and 2021, attracting hundreds of the world's leading researchers in the emerging field of biomolecular archaeology. In 2022, ISBA was officially founded as an academic society: the International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology. ISBA is a registered charity that promotes the study of biomolecular archaeology and adjacent sciences through the sponsorship of meetings, training workshops, web resources, and a biennial program of research prizes and awards.
