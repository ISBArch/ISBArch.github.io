The International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology (ISBA) is an international community of researchers working on degraded biological remains from a range of archaeological, paleoanthropological, and paleontological contexts. The society aims to promote the study of ancient biomolecules to better understand our shared human past. 

ISBA is composed of more than XXX members. [Society membership](/membership) supports our biennial [research prizes and awards](/awards), as well as [micro-grants](/funding) for workshops. Please see our [Meetings](/category/meetings) page for information about conference registration and abstract submission. 

ISBA uses Twitter ([@ISBArchaeology](https://twitter.com/ISBArchaeology)), as well as our website, to disseminate the [our latest news](/category/news) about our upcoming meetings, events, and other activities.

## History

<img align="right" width="300" src="/assets/images/tube_rack.png">
ISBA, the International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology, began as a small, biennial symposium organized in the Netherlands in 2004. Nine [international meetings](/category/meetings) were held between 2004 and 2021, attracting hundreds of the world's leading researchers in the emerging field of biomolecular archaeology. In 2022, ISBA was officially founded as an academic society: the International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology. ISBA is a registered charity that promotes the study of biomolecular archaeology and adjacent sciences through the sponsorship of meetings, training workshops, web resources, and a biennial program of research prizes and awards.
