The International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology (ISBA) is an international community of researchers working on degraded biological remains from a range of archaeological and paleontological contexts. The society aims to promote the study of ancient biomolecules to better understand our shared human past. 

ISBA is composed of more than XXX members. [Society membership](https://isbarchaeology.github.io/membership) supports our bi-annual research prizes and awards, as well as micro-grants for workshops. Please see our [Meetings](https://isbarchaeology.github.io/category/meetings) page for information about conference registration and abstract submission. 

ISBA uses Twitter ([@ISBArchaeology](https://twitter.com/ISBArchaeology)), as well as our website, to disseminate the [our latest news](https://isbarchaeology.github.io/category/news) about our upcoming meetings, events, and other activities. We also support a [Career](https://isbarchaeology.github.io/category/career) page for advertising studentships and job listings. 

ISBA is governed and structured under rules and regulations set by the [Charity Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission). See our [Board](https://isbarchaeology.github.io/board) page for more information. 

## History

ISBA, the International Symposium for Biomolecular Archaeology, began as a small, bi-annual symposium organized in the Netherlands in 2004. Nine [international meetings](https://isbarchaeology.github.io/category/meetings) were held between 2004 and 2021, attracting hundreds of the world's leading researchers in the emerging field of biomolecular archaeology. In 2022, ISBA was officially founded as an academic society: the International Society for Biomolecular Archaeology. ISBA is a registered charity that promotes the study of biomolecular archaeology and adjacent sciences through the sponsorship of meetings, training workshops, web resources, and a bi-annual program of research prizes and awards.
