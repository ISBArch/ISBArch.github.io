### Benefits of membership

ISBA sponsors a wide range of initiatives to support biomolecular archaeology, including a biennial ISBA meeting, student poster and presentation prizes, article awards, and workshop micro-grants. ISBA membership helps to fund these initiatives and to support the maintenance of our website, listserv, and social media accounts.

Membership is not required for ISBA conference registration, however members will receive a discount upon registration.

Membership fees are described in the table below.

| Type     | Cost | Duration |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| Student  | £15  | 2 years  |
| Standard | £30  | 2 years  |

Currently membership payment is only possible through PayPal.

<blockquote>
🛈 In some countries it is possible to pay without a PayPal account (see instructions below)! For those who do not have this option, we are working on setting up an alternative payment system, this will be announced on the mailing list and twitter.
</blockquote>
