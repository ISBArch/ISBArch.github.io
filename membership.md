### Benefits of membership

ISBA sponsors a wide range of initiatives to support biomolecular archaeology, including a biennial ISBA meeting, student poster and presentation prizes, article awards, and workshop micro-grants. ISBA membership helps to fund these initiatives and to support the maintenance of our website, listserv, and social media accounts.

Membership is not required for ISBA conference registration, however members will receive a discount upon registration.

Membership fees are described in the table below.

| Type     | Cost | Duration |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| Student  | ¬£15  | 2 years  |
| Standard | ¬£30  | 2 years  |

### Payment

Follow these buttons to pay by PayPal. PayPal should allow you to pay directly through your PayPal account, or by credit or debit card (also without an account for some countries). <i>This is our preferred method of payment and will expedite your membership order.</i>

If this is not available in your region, please see below for information how to pay via bank transfer.
