ISBA partners with affiliate researcher communities and working groups to support education, community-building, and research in biomolecular archaeology.

[**Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) Community)**](https://spaam-community.github.io/about/): a community of researchers focusing on ancient metagenomics. SPAAM supports open science initiatives to find solutions to common challenges and obstacles in the field. SPAAM sponsors collaborative projects, summer schools, a Slack channel, and a yearly workshop. Find out more [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/projects/).

[**MINAS Working Group**](https://spaam-community.github.io/projects/#minas-mixs-checklist): an initiative to develop a MIxS extension checklist designed specifically for ancient metagenomics, as well as collaborating with a working group in ancient human population genetics to develop a more general checklist for ancient DNA, provisionally called the ‘MInAS’ checklist (Minimum INformation about Ancient Sequences’).

**Current Issues in Ancient DNA Research (CIADR)**: an international group of researchers who are practitioners of ancient DNA research. The CIADR group convenes virtually several times a year in order to discuss pertinent issues in ancient DNA research and strengthen bonds across the research community. For more information contact the CIADR organizers: Lara CAssidy (cassidl1@tcd.ie), Mateja Hajdinjak (mateja.hajdinak@crick.ac.uk), Kendra Sirak (kendra_sirak@hms.harvard.edu), Viviane Slon (viviane@tauex.tau.ac.il)
