ISBA affiliates with a range of researcher communities and working groups to support education, community-building, and research in biomolecular archaeology.

[**Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) Community)**](https://spaam-community.github.io/about/): a community of researchers focusing on ancient metagenomics. SPAAM supports open science initiatives to find solutions to common challenges and obstacles in the field. SPAAM sponsors collaborative projects, summer schools, a Slack channel, and a yearly workshop. Find out more [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/projects/#minas-mixs-checklist).

[**MINAS Working Group**](https://spaam-community.github.io/projects/#minas-mixs-checklist): an initiative to develop a MIxS extension checklist designed specifically for ancient metagenomics, as well as collaborating with a working group in ancient human population genetics to develop a more general checklist for ancient DNA, provisionally called the ‘MInAS’ checklist (Minimum INformation about Ancient Sequences’).
