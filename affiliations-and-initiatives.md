The [**Animal aDNA Research Community (AaRC)**](https://www.animal-adna.org/) aims to bring together early career researchers applying genomic approaches to ancient animal remains and nucleotide-preserving material.

By providing an inclusive environment, AaRC will promote knowledge exchange and collaboration between researchers regardless of their institutional or disciplinary background; facilitate the establishment of community-led standards, best practices and resources; and provide a platform for the sharing of research and knowledge.

AaRC is envisioned to be primarily run by and for early career researchers (graduate student, post-doctoral researchers, and early group leaders), but researchers of all career stages are welcome to join and participate in the community.

AaRC’s mission is to provide:

- Scientific advancement (via community-driven projects to advance the field)
- Training and support (through resources and courses to facilitate knowledge sharing and quality of research)
- Networking (by facilitating collaborations and assisting each other) for the animal ancient DNA community."

**Current Issues in Ancient DNA Research (CIADR)**: an international group of researchers who are practitioners of ancient DNA research. The CIADR group convenes virtually several times a year in order to discuss pertinent issues in ancient DNA research and strengthen bonds across the research community. For more information contact the CIADR organizers: Lara CAssidy (cassidl1@tcd.ie), Mateja Hajdinjak (mateja.hajdinak@crick.ac.uk), Kendra Sirak (kendra_sirak@hms.harvard.edu), Viviane Slon (viviane@tauex.tau.ac.il)
