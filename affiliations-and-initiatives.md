[**Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) Community**](https://spaam-community.github.io/about/): a community of researchers focusing on ancient metagenomics. SPAAM supports open science initiatives to find solutions to common challenges and obstacles in the field. SPAAM sponsors collaborative projects, summer schools, a Slack channel, and a yearly workshop. Find out more [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/projects/).

[**Palaeoproteomics And Archaeology, Society for Techniques and Advances (PAASTA) Community**](https://paasta-community.github.io/about/): An ECR-led community of researchers working with palaeoproteomics, the study of ancient proteins. An open and supportive environment committed to promoting and facilitating collaborative and open science! Find out more [here](https://paasta-community.github.io/about/).

[**Human Ancient DNA, Ancestry, and Mobility (HAAM) Community**](https://haam-community.github.io/): an open community of international researchers interested in studying human population genetics, ancestry & mobility through ancient/modern DNA. HAAM plans to find common solutions to small and big challenges encountered worldwide, plan summer schools, and promote collaborative projects. Find out more [here](https://haam-community.github.io/).

**Current Issues in Ancient DNA Research (CIADR)**: an international group of researchers who are practitioners of ancient DNA research. The CIADR group convenes virtually several times a year in order to discuss pertinent issues in ancient DNA research and strengthen bonds across the research community. For more information contact the CIADR organizers: Lara CAssidy (cassidl1@tcd.ie), Mateja Hajdinjak (mateja.hajdinak@crick.ac.uk), Kendra Sirak (kendra_sirak@hms.harvard.edu), Viviane Slon (viviane@tauex.tau.ac.il)
